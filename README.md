## Description
The logo generator is a command-line application built in Node.js that allows users to generate simple logos for their projects.
The application prompts the user to enter up to three characters for the logo's text, choose a text color, select a shape from options (triangle, circle, or square), and pick a shape color. Based on the user's input, the logo generator creates an SVG file that represents the logo and saves it as "logo.svg" in the application's directory.

## Usage <a name='usage'></a>
The logo generator serves as a convenient and cost-effective tool for creating basic logos, enabling users to have a visual representation of their projects without the need for specialized design skills or hiring external designers. It's particularly valuable for small-scale projects, personal websites, or quick prototyping where a simple logo is sufficient to convey the project's identity.
