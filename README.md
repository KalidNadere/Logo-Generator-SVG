## Description
The logo generator is a command-line application built in Node.js that allows users to generate simple logos for their projects.
The application prompts the user to enter up to three characters for the logo's text, choose a text color, select a shape from options (triangle, circle, or square), and pick a shape color. Based on the user's input, the logo generator creates an SVG file that represents the logo and saves it as "logo.svg" in the application's directory.
